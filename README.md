Project was completed using Ruby on Rails used for the backend and PostgreSQL for the database. As a group we worked closely with Github, handling Git conflicts like a champ. We also incorporated Ajax, Javascript, and Ruby, along with a handful of APIâ€™s such as Google Maps and Event Listings, and News.
